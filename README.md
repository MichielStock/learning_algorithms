Algorithms relevant to my PhD

Contains up to now:
 - Ridge_regression: files for the regular ridge regression as well as the Kroncker-based methods for two objects
 - Relational_stochastic_gradient_descent: implements SGD methods for relational learning using Theano
 - Matrix_facorisation: toy implementation of robust PCA, other algorithms and applications may be added on the long run
 - Efficient_querying: algorithms to query a long list using machine learning models
 - Self_organising_maps: implementation of a self-organising map
